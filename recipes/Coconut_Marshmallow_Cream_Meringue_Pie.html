        <li>5 cups light cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>2 (9 inch) pie shells, baked</li>
        <li>9 egg whites</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the filling combine light cream or half and half and butter in saucepan. Bring just to boil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>In medium bowl, whisk together sugar, 3 eggs, cornstarch, vanilla and salt until cornstarch is completely dissolved and mixture is well blended.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the egg mixture to the mixture in saucepan, stirring constantly with wire whisk. Cook, stirring constantly, about 1 minute or until thickened. Add marshmallows and 1/4 cup of the coconut. Cook and stir until marshmallows melt and mixture is well-blended. Pour into pie shells. Refrigerate at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>For meringue, in large bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Add sugar, a small amount at a time, beating constantly until stiff peaks form. Spread half the meringue over each pie to edge of crust. Sprinkle each with 1/4 cup of the remaining coconut.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Chill any leftovers.</li>
    </ol>
